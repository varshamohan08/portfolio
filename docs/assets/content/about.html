<p>
    Hey there! I'm Varsha Mohan 👋, a code enthusiast who turns coffee into code (and occasionally, bugs into features). My journey involves crafting web applications that not only function seamlessly but also shine!
    <br><br>
    By day 🌞, I’m a full-stack developer specializing in Python, Django, and Angular. I thrive on solving complex problems, whether it's optimizing SQL queries or designing intuitive user interfaces. My goal is to enhance the web experience, one line of code at a time.
    <br><br>
    By night 🌜, I dive into tech trends, online courses 🎓, and side projects. I’m always on the hunt for the next cool thing to learn 📚 or the next challenge to conquer.
    <br><br>
    I’m a big believer in the power of teamwork and collaboration, but I’m also not afraid to roll up my sleeves and dive into a solo project. Whether it’s brainstorming ideas, writing clean and efficient code, or debugging like a detective, I'm passionate about all things web.
    <br><br>
    When I’m not in front of a screen 🖥️, you might find me immersed in a fiction book 📖, catching up on the latest anime, or dreaming up my next big idea. Life’s all about balance, after all!
    <br><br>
    Let’s connect and create something amazing! Whether you have a project in mind or want to chat about tech 🗨️, I’m all ears.
